| `write_file.py`           | Writes text to a new file                    |
| `append_story.py`         | Appends story lines to an existing file      |
| `file_test.py`            | Tests reading/writing operations             |
| `read_story.py`           | Reads the story after multiple writes        |
| `read_updated_story.py`   | Reads updated version of story               |
| `read_line_notes.py`      | Reads files line by line                     |
| `read_lines_notes.py`     | Reads multiple lines using `readlines()`     |
| `mini_task.py`            | Small combined proof using all file methods  |
| `pointer_control.py`      | Shows file pointer behavior                  |
| `Sample.txt`              | Sample input file                            |
| `story.txt`               | Story file used for appending/reading        |

## 🌱 Skills Demonstrated

- `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `append()`, `close()` methods
- File pointer usage (`seek()`, `tell()`)
- Modular program structure (`import` usage)
- Terminal & Git basics:
  - `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git remote`, `git push`

## 💡 Learning Reflection

This checkpoint helped reinforce my confidence in:
- Creating structured file-based Python projects
- Understanding how to interact with `.txt` files
- Writing clean, modular scripts for real-world usage
- Practicing GitHub workflow for publishing proof
